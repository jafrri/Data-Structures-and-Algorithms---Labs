# DSA Labs Repository

Welcome to the DSA Labs repository for the semester! This repository contains practical implementations of essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), including sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, binary search tree operations, and minimum spanning tree implementations.

## Contents

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes implementations of various sorting techniques like bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
2. **Graph Algorithms**: Implementations of graph traversal (DFS, BFS) and shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's).
3. **Binary Search Tree**: Operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal in binary search trees.
4. **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Implementations of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.

## Usage
